### Thanks

Sinatra would not have been possible without strong company backing.
In the past, financial and emotional support have been provided mainly by
[Heroku](http://heroku.com), [GitHub](https://github.com) and
[Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/), and is now taken care of by
[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.com/).
