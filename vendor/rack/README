= Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the Rack specification,
which all Rack applications should conform to.

== Supported web servers

The included *handlers* connect all kinds of web servers to Rack:
* Mongrel
* EventedMongrel
* WEBrick
* FCGI
* CGI
* SCGI
* LiteSpeed

These web servers include Rack handlers in their distributions:
* Ebb
* Fuzed
* Thin

Any valid Rack app will run the same on all these handlers, without
changing anything.

== Supported web frameworks

The included *adapters* connect Rack with existing Ruby web frameworks:
* Camping

These frameworks include Rack adapters in their distributions:
* Coset
* Halcyon
* Maveric
* Merb
* Racktools::SimpleApplication
* Ramaze
* Sinatra
* Vintage

Ruby on Rails can be run with the adapter included with Thin, which
will be merged into a later Rack version.

Current links to these projects can be found at
http://ramaze.net/#other-frameworks

== Available middleware

Between the server and the framework, Rack can be customized to your
applications needs using middleware, for example:
* Rack::URLMap, to route to multiple applications inside the same process.
* Rack::CommonLogger, for creating Apache-style logfiles.
* Rack::ShowException, for catching unhandled exceptions and
  presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.
* Rack::File, for serving static files.
* ...many others!

All these components use the same interface, which is described in
detail in the Rack specification.  You can choose to use them exactly
in the way you want.

== Convenience

If you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your
own ones, or develop middleware, Rack provides many helpers to create
Rack applications quickly and without doing the same web stuff all
over:
* Rack::Request, which also provides query string parsing and
  multipart handling.
* Rack::Response, for convenient generation of HTTP replies and
  cookie handling.
* Rack::MockRequest and Rack::MockResponse for efficient and quick
  testing of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.

== rackup

rackup is a useful tool for running Rack applications, which uses the
Rack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications
easily.

rackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and
runs your application as FastCGI, CGI, or standalone with Mongrel or
WEBrick---all from the same configuration.

== Quick start

Try the lobster!

Either with the embedded WEBrick starter:

    ruby -Ilib lib/rack/lobster.rb

Or with rackup:

    bin/rackup -Ilib example/lobster.ru 

By default, the lobster is found at http://localhost:9292.

== Installing with RubyGems

A Gem of Rack is available.  You can install it with:

    gem install rack

I also provide a local mirror of the gems (and development snapshots)
at my site:

    gem install rack --source http://chneukirchen.org/releases/gems

== Running the tests

Testing Rack requires the test/spec testing framework:

    gem install test-spec

The full set of tests also test FCGI access with lighttpd so you will
need lighttpd installed as well as the FCGI libraries and the fcgi gem
installed:

Download and install lighttpd:

    http://www.lighttpd.net/download

Installing the FCGI libraries:

    curl -O http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    tar xzvf fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    cd fcgi-2.4.0
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install
    cd ..

Installing the Ruby fcgi gem:

    gem install fcgi

There are two rake-based test tasks:

    rake test       tests all the fast tests (no Handlers or Adapters)
    rake fulltest   runs all the tests
