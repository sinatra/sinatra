= 1.0 / 2010-01-28 (prerelease)

 * It's now possible to register blocks to run after each request using
   after filters. After filters run at the end of each request, after
   routes and error handlers. (Jimmy Schementi)

 * Sinatra now uses Tilt <http://github.com/rtomayko/tilt> for rendering
   templates. This adds support for template caching, consistent
   template backtraces, and support for new template engines, like
   mustache and liquid. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * ERB, Erubis, and Haml templates are now compiled the first time
   they're rendered instead of being string eval'd on each invocation.
   Benchmarks show a 5x-10x improvement in render time. This also
   reduces the number of objects created, decreasing pressure on Ruby's
   GC. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * New 'settings' method gives access to options in both class and request
   scopes. This replaces the 'options' method. (Chris Wanstrath)

 * New boolean 'reload_templates' setting controls whether template files
   are reread from disk and recompiled on each request. Template read/compile
   is cached by default in all environments except development. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * New 'erubis' helper method for rendering ERB template with Erubis. The
   erubis gem is required. (Dylan Egan)

 * New 'cache_control' helper method provides a convenient way of
   setting the Cache-Control response header. Takes a variable number
   of boolean directives followed by a hash of value directives, like
   this: cache_control :public, :must_revalidate, :max_age => 60
   (Ryan Tomayko)

 * New 'expires' helper method is like cache_control but takes an
   integer number of seconds or Time object:
   expires 300, :public, :must_revalidate
   (Ryan Tomayko)

 * New request.secure? method for checking for an SSL connection.
   (Adam Wiggins)

 * Sinatra apps can now be run with a `-o <addr>` argument to specify
   the address to bind to. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * Rack::Session::Cookie is now added to the middleware pipeline when
   running in test environments if the :sessions option is set.
   (Simon Rozet)

 * Route handlers, before filters, templates, error mappings, and
   middleware are now resolved dynamically up the inheritance hierarchy
   when needed instead of duplicating the superclass's version when
   a new Sinatra::Base subclass is created. This should fix a variety
   of issues with extensions that need to add any of these things
   to the base class. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * Exception error handlers always override the raise_errors option now.
   Previously, all exceptions would be raised outside of the application
   when the raise_errors option was enabled, even if an error handler was
   defined for that exception. The raise_errors option now controls
   whether unhandled exceptions are raised (enabled) or if a generic 500
   error is returned (disabled). (Ryan Tomayko)

 * The X-Cascade response header is set to 'pass' when no matching route
   is found or all routes pass. (Josh Peek)

 * Filters do not run when serving static files anymore. (Ryan Tomayko)

 * pass takes an optional block to be used as the route handler if no
   subsequent route matches the request. (Blake Mizerany)

The following Sinatra features have been obsoleted (removed entirely) in
the 1.0 release:

 * The `sinatra/test` library is obsolete. This includes the `Sinatra::Test`
   module, the `Sinatra::TestHarness` class, and the `get_it`, `post_it`,
   `put_it`, `delete_it`, and `head_it` helper methods. The
   [`Rack::Test` library](http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/rack-test) should
   be used instead.

 * Test framework specific libraries (`sinatra/test/spec`,
   `sinatra/test/bacon`,`sinatra/test/rspec`, etc.) are obsolete. See
   http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html for instructions on setting up a
   testing environment under each of these frameworks.

 * `Sinatra::Default` is obsolete; use `Sinatra::Base` instead.
   `Sinatra::Base` acts more like `Sinatra::Default` in development mode.
   For example, static file serving and sexy development error pages are
   enabled by default.

 * Auto-requiring template libraries in the `erb`, `builder`, `haml`,
   and `sass` methods is obsolete due to thread-safety issues. You must
   require the template libraries explicitly in your app.

 * The `:views_directory` option to rendering methods is obsolete; use
   `:views` instead.

 * The `:haml` and `:sass` options to rendering methods are obsolete.
   Template engine options should be passed in the second Hash argument
   instead.

 * The `use_in_file_templates` method is obsolete. Use
   `enable :inline_templates` or `set :inline_templates, 'path/to/file'`

 * The 'media_type' helper method is obsolete. Use 'mime_type' instead.

 * The 'mime' main and class method is obsolete. Use 'mime_type' instead.

 * The request-level `send_data` method is no longer supported.

 * The `Sinatra::Event` and `Sinatra::EventContext` classes are no longer
   supported. This may effect extensions written for versions prior to 0.9.2.
   See [Writing Sinatra Extensions](http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html)
   for the officially supported extensions API.

 * The `set_option` and `set_options` methods are obsolete; use `set`
   instead.

 * The `:env` setting (`settings.env`) is obsolete; use `:environment`
   instead.

 * The request level `stop` method is obsolete; use `halt` instead.

 * The request level `entity_tag` method is obsolete; use `etag`
   instead.

 * The request level `headers` method (HTTP response headers) is obsolete;
   use `response['Header-Name']` instead.

 * `Sinatra.application` is obsolete; use `Sinatra::Application` instead.

 * Using `Sinatra.application = nil` to reset an application is obsolete.
   This should no longer be necessary.

 * Using `Sinatra.default_options` to set base configuration items is
   obsolete; use `Sinatra::Base.set(key, value)` instead.

 * The `Sinatra::ServerError` exception is obsolete. All exceptions raised
   within a request are now treated as internal server errors and result in
   a 500 response status.

 * The `:methodoverride' option to enable/disable the POST _method hack is
   obsolete; use `:method_override` instead.

= 0.9.2 / 2009-05-18

 * This version is compatible with Rack 1.0. [Rein Henrichs]

 * The development-mode unhandled exception / error page has been
   greatly enhanced, functionally and aesthetically. The error
   page is used when the :show_exceptions option is enabled and an
   exception propagates outside of a route handler or before filter.
   [Simon Rozet / Matte Noble / Ryan Tomayko]

 * Backtraces that move through templates now include filenames and
   line numbers where possible. [#51 / S. Brent Faulkner]

 * All templates now have an app-level option for setting default
   template options (:haml, :sass, :erb, :builder). The app-level
   option value must be a Hash if set and is merged with the
   template options specified to the render method (Base#haml,
   Base#erb, Base#builder). [S. Brent Faulkner, Ryan Tomayko]

 * The method signature for all template rendering methods has
   been unified: "def engine(template, options={}, locals={})".
   The options Hash now takes the generic :views, :layout, and
   :locals options but also any template-specific options. The
   generic options are removed before calling the template specific
   render method. Locals may be specified using either the
   :locals key in the options hash or a second Hash option to the
   rendering method. [#191 / Ryan Tomayko]

 * The receiver is now passed to "configure" blocks. This
   allows for the following idiom in top-level apps:
   configure { |app| set :foo, app.root + '/foo' }
   [TJ Holowaychuck / Ryan Tomayko]

 * The "sinatra/test" lib is deprecated and will be removed in
   Sinatra 1.0. This includes the Sinatra::Test module and
   Sinatra::TestHarness class in addition to all the framework
   test helpers that were deprecated in 0.9.1. The Rack::Test
   lib should be used instead: http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/rack-test
   [#176 / Simon Rozet]

 * Development mode source file reloading has been removed. The
   "shotgun" (http://rtomayko.github.com/shotgun/) program can be
   used to achieve the same basic functionality in most situations.
   Passenger users should use the "tmp/always_restart.txt"
   file (http://tinyurl.com/c67o4h). [#166 / Ryan Tomayko]

 * Auto-requiring template libs in the erb, builder, haml, and
   sass methods is deprecated due to thread-safety issues. You must
   require the template libs explicitly in your app file. [Simon Rozet]

 * A new Sinatra::Base#route_missing method was added. route_missing
   is sent when no route matches the request or all route handlers
   pass.  The default implementation forwards the request to the
   downstream app when running as middleware (i.e., "@app" is
   non-nil), or raises a NotFound exception when no downstream app
   is defined. Subclasses can override this method to perform custom
   route miss logic. [Jon Crosby]

 * A new Sinatra::Base#route_eval method was added. The method
   yields to the block and throws :halt with the result. Subclasses
   can override this method to tap into the route execution logic.
   [TJ Holowaychuck]

 * Fix the "-x" (enable request mutex / locking) command line
   argument. Passing -x now properly sets the :lock option.
   [S. Brent Faulkner, Ryan Tomayko]

 * Fix writer ("foo=") and predicate ("foo?") methods in extension
   modules not being added to the registering class.
   [#172 / Pat Nakajima]

 * Fix in-file templates when running alongside activesupport and
   fatal errors when requiring activesupport before sinatra
   [#178 / Brian Candler]

 * Fix various issues running on Google AppEngine.
   [Samuel Goebert, Simon Rozet]

 * Fix in-file templates __END__ detection when __END__ exists with
   other stuff on a line [Yoji Shidara]

= 0.9.1.1 / 2009-03-09

 * Fix directory traversal vulnerability in default static files
   route. See [#177] for more info.

= 0.9.1 / 2009-03-01

 * Sinatra now runs under Ruby 1.9.1 [#61]

 * Route patterns (splats, :named, or Regexp captures) are now
   passed as arguments to the block. [#140]

 * The "helpers" method now takes a variable number of modules
   along with the normal block syntax. [#133]

 * New request-level #forward method for middleware components: passes
   the env to the downstream app and merges the response status, headers,
   and body into the current context. [#126]

 * Requests are now automatically forwarded to the downstream app when
   running as middleware and no matching route is found or all routes
   pass.

 * New simple API for extensions/plugins to add DSL-level and
   request-level methods. Use Sinatra.register(mixin) to extend
   the DSL with all public methods defined in the mixin module;
   use Sinatra.helpers(mixin) to make all public methods defined
   in the mixin module available at the request level. [#138]
   See http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions.html for details.

 * Named parameters in routes now capture the "." character. This makes
   routes like "/:path/:filename" match against requests like
   "/foo/bar.txt"; in this case, "params[:filename]" is "bar.txt".
   Previously, the route would not match at all.

 * Added request-level "redirect back" to redirect to the referring
   URL.

 * Added a new "clean_trace" option that causes backtraces dumped
   to rack.errors and displayed on the development error page to
   omit framework and core library backtrace lines. The option is
   enabled by default. [#77]

 * The ERB output buffer is now available to helpers via the @_out_buf
   instance variable.

 * It's now much easier to test sessions in unit tests by passing a
   ":session" option to any of the mock request methods. e.g.,
       get '/', {}, :session => { 'foo' => 'bar' }

 * The testing framework specific files ('sinatra/test/spec',
   'sinatra/test/bacon', 'sinatra/test/rspec', etc.) have been deprecated.
   See http://sinatrarb.com/testing.html for instructions on setting up
   a testing environment with these frameworks.

 * The request-level #send_data method from Sinatra 0.3.3 has been added
   for compatibility but is deprecated.

 * Fix :provides causing crash on any request when request has no
   Accept header [#139]

 * Fix that ERB templates were evaluated twice per "erb" call.

 * Fix app-level middleware not being run when the Sinatra application is
   run as middleware.

 * Fixed some issues with running under Rack's CGI handler caused by
   writing informational stuff to stdout.

 * Fixed that reloading was sometimes enabled when starting from a
   rackup file [#110]

 * Fixed that "." in route patterns erroneously matched any character
   instead of a literal ".". [#124]

= 0.9.0.4 / 2009-01-25

 * Using halt with more than 1 args causes ArgumentError [#131]
 * using halt in a before filter doesn't modify response [#127]
 * Add deprecated Sinatra::EventContext to unbreak plugins [#130]
 * Give access to GET/POST params in filters [#129]
 * Preserve non-nested params in nested params hash [#117]
 * Fix backtrace dump with Rack::Lint [#116]

= 0.9.0.3 / 2009-01-21

 * Fall back on mongrel then webrick when thin not found. [#75]
 * Use :environment instead of :env in test helpers to
   fix deprecation warnings coming from framework.
 * Make sinatra/test/rspec work again [#113]
 * Fix app_file detection on windows [#118]
 * Fix static files with Rack::Lint in pipeline [#121]

= 0.9.0.2 / 2009-01-18

 * Halting a before block should stop processing of routes [#85]
 * Fix redirect/halt in before filters [#85]

= 0.9.0 / 2009-01-18

 * Works with and requires Rack >= 0.9.1

 * Multiple Sinatra applications can now co-exist peacefully within a
   single process. The new "Sinatra::Base" class can be subclassed to
   establish a blank-slate Rack application or middleware component.
   Documentation on using these features is forth-coming; the following
   provides the basic gist: http://gist.github.com/38605

 * Parameters with subscripts are now parsed into a nested/recursive
   Hash structure. e.g., "post[title]=Hello&post[body]=World" yields
   params: {'post' => {'title' => 'Hello', 'body' => 'World'}}.

 * Regular expressions may now be used in route pattens; captures are
   available at "params[:captures]".

 * New ":provides" route condition takes an array of mime types and
   matches only when an Accept request header is present with a
   corresponding type. [cypher]

 * New request-level "pass" method; immediately exits the current block
   and passes control to the next matching route.

 * The request-level "body" method now takes a block; evaluation is
   deferred until an attempt is made to read the body. The block must
   return a String or Array.

 * New "route conditions" system for attaching rules for when a route
   matches. The :agent and :host route options now use this system.

 * New "dump_errors" option controls whether the backtrace is dumped to
   rack.errors when an exception is raised from a route. The option is
   enabled by default for top-level apps.

 * Better default "app_file", "root", "public", and "views" location
   detection; changes to "root" and "app_file" automatically cascade to
   other options that depend on them.

 * Error mappings are now split into two distinct layers: exception
   mappings and custom error pages. Exception mappings are registered
   with "error(Exception)" and are run only when the app raises an
   exception. Custom error pages are registered with "error(status_code)",
   where "status_code" is an integer, and are run any time the response
   has the status code specified. It's also possible to register an error
   page for a range of status codes: "error(500..599)".

 * In-file templates are now automatically imported from the file that
   requires 'sinatra'. The use_in_file_templates! method is still available
   for loading templates from other files.

 * Sinatra's testing support is no longer dependent on Test::Unit. Requiring
   'sinatra/test' adds the Sinatra::Test module and Sinatra::TestHarness
   class, which can be used with any test framework. The 'sinatra/test/unit',
   'sinatra/test/spec', 'sinatra/test/rspec', or 'sinatra/test/bacon' files
   can be required to setup a framework-specific testing environment. See the
   README for more information.

 * Added support for Bacon (test framework). The 'sinatra/test/bacon' file
   can be required to setup Sinatra test helpers on Bacon::Context.

 * Deprecated "set_option" and "set_options"; use "set" instead.

 * Deprecated the "env" option ("options.env"); use "environment" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "stop" method; use "halt" instead.

 * Deprecated the request level "entity_tag" method; use "etag" instead.
   Both "entity_tag" and "etag" were previously supported.

 * Deprecated the request level "headers" method (HTTP response headers);
   use "response['Header-Name']" instead.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.application"; use "Sinatra::Application" instead.

 * Deprecated setting Sinatra.application = nil to reset an application.
   This should no longer be necessary.

 * Deprecated "Sinatra.default_options"; use
   "Sinatra::Default.set(key, value)" instead.

 * Deprecated the "ServerError" exception. All Exceptions are now
   treated as internal server errors and result in a 500 response
   status.

 * Deprecated the "get_it", "post_it", "put_it", "delete_it", and "head_it"
   test helper methods. Use "get", "post", "put", "delete", and "head",
   respectively, instead.

 * Removed Event and EventContext classes. Applications are defined in a
   subclass of Sinatra::Base; each request is processed within an
   instance.

= 0.3.3 / 2009-01-06

 * Pin to Rack 0.4.0 (this is the last release on Rack 0.4)

 * Log unhandled exception backtraces to rack.errors.

 * Use RACK_ENV environment variable to establish Sinatra
   environment when given. Thin sets this when started with
   the -e argument.

 * BUG: raising Sinatra::NotFound resulted in a 500 response
   code instead of 404.

 * BUG: use_in_file_templates! fails with CR/LF (#45)

 * BUG: Sinatra detects the app file and root path when run under
   thin/passenger.

= 0.3.2

 * BUG: Static and send_file read entire file into String before
   sending. Updated to stream with 8K chunks instead.

 * Rake tasks and assets for building basic documentation website.
   See http://sinatra.rubyforge.org

 * Various minor doc fixes.

= 0.3.1

 * Unbreak optional path parameters [jeremyevans]

= 0.3.0

 * Add sinatra.gemspec w/ support for github gem builds. Forks can now
   enable the build gem option in github to get free username-sinatra.gem
   builds: gem install username-sinatra.gem --source=http://gems.github.com/

 * Require rack-0.4 gem; removes frozen rack dir.

 * Basic RSpec support; require 'sinatra/test/rspec' instead of
   'sinatra/test/spec' to use. [avdi]

 * before filters can modify request environment vars used for
   routing (e.g., PATH_INFO, REQUEST_METHOD, etc.) for URL rewriting
   type functionality.

 * In-file templates now uses @@ instead of ## as template separator.

 * Top-level environment test predicates: development?, test?, production?

 * Top-level "set", "enable", and "disable" methods for tweaking
   app options. [rtomayko]

 * Top-level "use" method for building Rack middleware pipelines
   leading to app. See README for usage. [rtomayko]

 * New "reload" option - set false to disable reloading in development.

 * New "host" option - host/ip to bind to [cschneid]

 * New "app_file" option - override the file to reload in development
   mode [cschneid]

 * Development error/not_found page cleanup [sr, adamwiggins]
