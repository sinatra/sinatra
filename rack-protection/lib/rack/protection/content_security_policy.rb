    # Description:: Content Security Policy, is a mechanism web applications
    #               can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection
    #               vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
    #               Content Security Policy is a declarative policy that lets
    #               the authors (or server administrators) of a web application
    #               inform the client about the sources from which the
    #               application expects to load resources.

    # == Options
    #
    # ContentSecurityPolicy configuration is a complex topic with
    # several levels of support that has evolved over time.
    # See the W3C documentation and the links in the more info
    # section for CSP usage examples and best practices.
    #
    # [<tt>:report_only</tt>] - if true, the <tt>content-security-policy-report-only</tt>
    #                           header is set, instead of <tt>content-security-policy</tt>. Note that 
    #                           in this case, you should also set the <tt>:report_uri</tt> option and the 
    #                           <tt>:report_to</tt> option.  If you *do* set <tt>:report_to</tt>, you must 
    #                           also set the `reporting-endpoints` header yourself.
    #
    # [<tt>:default_src</tt>] - sets the <tt>default-src</tt> directive, which acts as a
    #                           fallback for any directive you don't specify. Default is <tt>'self'</tt>.
    #
    # [Any Supported CSP Directive, underscorized] - All supported CSP directives can be configured individually. See DIRECTIVES 
    #                                                and NO_ARG_DIRECTIVES for a list of what is supported.
    #
    #                                                Note that this list is not necessarly complete as the spec and
    #                                                browser behavior is constantly evolving (for example,
    #                                                <tt>script-src-elem</tt> is not supported).
    #                                                
    #                                                Pass in an underscorized symbol. For example, to set the <tt>script-src</tt> 
    #                                                directive, use <tt>:script_src</tt>.  The value should be whatever value you 
    #                                                want set in the header.
    #
    #                                                Note that for directives that do not take an argument, you must set their 
    #                                                value to <tt>true</tt> to ensure they are set. See NO_ARG_DIRECTIVES.
    #                                                Note that <tt>'self'</tt> and <tt>'none'</tt> require 
    #                                                single quotes and this middleware will not add them. For example, to 
    #                                                disallow <tt>iframe</tt>s, you would need to use <tt>frame_src: 
    #                                                "'none'"</tt>.
